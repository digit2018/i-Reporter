                    <h1>Corruption Title2</h1>
                    <blockquote>
                        Generally a contractor or a supplier who supplies
                        goods for the heavy machines or any kind of supplies 
                        which you need in coalmines has to pay 20% to 30% of 
                        the total cost to the officials at his client's head 
                        office. First he needs to pay to get the work and then
                        to get his fees and costs paid from the finance departments. 
                        Or, as is often the case, he needs to pay to get them to turn
                        a blind eye to the substandard materials he is using. When 
                        I needed a passport we had to pay a certain amount to the 
                        agent who is in hand-in-glove with the passport officers.
                        Next step is when the verification reaches the nearest local
                        police station of wherever we live. The officers are meant to 
                        visit us to verify the application but instead they just call
                        us to the police station and – if they know you are at all 
                        comfortable in terms of money – ask for cash. They just say:
                        "You are earning well. Give us some money for tea." This is 
                        a regular practice.
